## About Me

I am a GRC engineer focused on building systems that reduce real security risk while minimizing compliance overhead. My work sits at the intersection of vulnerability management, cloud security, and control governance, with an emphasis on automation, data normalization, and repeatable workflows.

Rather than treating compliance as a documentation exercise, I design solutions that treat controls as measurable, testable system behaviors. My approach is to integrate directly with scanning tools, cloud platforms, and APIs to eliminate manual analysis and shift effort toward remediation and risk reduction.

I spend most of my time engineering solutions that translate raw security data into control-aligned decisions that engineers, ISSOs, and leadership can act on without friction.

## Design Philosophy

Effective GRC should be engineered, not narrated.

Security tooling already produces the data needed for compliance, but many programs fail by forcing humans to manually interpret, reformat, and defend that data after the fact. I design systems that move interpretation upstream and automate it at the source.

I focus on:
- Consuming raw scanner and cloud data rather than exported reports
- Normalizing findings into control-mapped risk objects
- Automating POA&M creation, updates, and closure validation
- Treating compliance artifacts as outputs of systems, not separate work products
- Prioritizing workflows that drive remediation over documentation

If a control cannot be measured, tracked, or continuously validated, it is a design failure.

## POA&M Manager – Nexus

POA&M Manager – Nexus is a practical implementation of my GRC engineering approach.

The tool ingests raw vulnerability scan outputs directly from scanning platforms, normalizes findings across tools, and maps them to control requirements without manual spreadsheet analysis. It automatically generates and updates POA&M workbooks, tracks remediation progress, and supports real-time metrics on risk aging and closure.

The result is a POA&M process that stays synchronized with scanning data, reduces administrative overhead, and allows security teams to focus on remediation instead of maintaining documents.
